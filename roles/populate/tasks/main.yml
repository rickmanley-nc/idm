User:
Tammy Larsen ... uid 'dev-admin' and add 'developer-admin' Group
Jimmy Pesto ... uid 'dev' and add 'developer' Group
Turd Ferguson ... uid 'ops-admin' and add 'operations-admin' Group
Randy Flanders ... uid 'ops-jr' and add 'operations-jr-admin' Group
Louise Belcher ... uid 'lobuser' and add 'lob' Group

Host Group, development-servers.
Create Automember role for development-servers, ipa automember-add --type=hostgroup development-servers
--- need to find out what the regex should be --- Create Automember role condition,  ipa automember-add-condition â€“-key=userclass --type=hostgroup --inclusive-regex=^Development_Servers development-servers
